# make directory
mkdir webproject

# copy document from one folder to the other
cp source destination

# copy file 
cp -R source destination

# find out the path of the file
realpath test.doc


#create a new branch of the remote branch(not master)
$ git branch -a
$ git checkout remote branch
$ git branch -b branchname

-----the other way to do it(this will set the remotebranch as the upstream)
$git checout -b localbranchname remotebranch

# remote master repo change name, local need to update with o
$git remote rm origin 
$git remote add origin ssh://git@xxxxxx.git
$git remote -v

------------------------------------------
# if you have less commits to checkout and master has updates you need to rebase
create a local master branch and cherry pick the commit#
$git cherry-pick commit#
